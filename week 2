FIRST PRINCIPLES

FOOTWEAR

Video:

Your foot health is a direct reflection of how you use your feet

How you use your feet is primarily determined by the environment - the clothing you cover your feet with - aka the shoes you wear

Footwear is really quite simple: if you wear natural footwear, you will restore natural foot function. If you wear unnatural footwear, you will inhibit
natural foot function. Let's clearly define the two terms:

Natural footwear:

Unnatural footwear:

All footwear exists on a continuum from natural to unnatural. The goal is to gradually shift away from unnatural and towards natural. 



reflection/practice:
- Explain how unnatural footwear causes bunions through SAID principle
- Explain the scientific method

Experiment: purchase a pair of natural shoes (www.thefootcollective.store) and make them your daily drivers
