Idea: part of FNT is offering an education experience. Small or large. To get your dogtag and be a true foot nerd, you must have given a workshop

Small: invite 3 friends over (bribe them with food) and give them a free session, collect feedback
medium: approach a gym/yoga studio and offer a 2 hour experience for 5-10 people
large: organize a half day workshop at a local gym/fitness facility, coordinate toolkits for everyone

FNT is a commitment to growing as a person. Growing your knowledge by restoring your foot health, making a commitment to spread the message in your
community and get paid to do that


2-4 hour in person experiences

Essentials:
- Screens
- First principles
- Protect, correct, develop
- Footwear 101
- Hips 101 (ground living)
- Balance training (mental focus training, lower body recalibration)
- Play


Each Nerd can make this their own

Keys to organizing a great workshop

The responsibility of teaching

can be independently scheduled or promoted/scheduled/booked through TFC (20-50%)

-------

- Being adaptable in your delivery
- Confidence is the result of deep understanding
- Mastery mindset. Always seeking to improve content, always seeking feedback, always seeking to improve our delivery
- Deliver sticky golden nuggets (4f's, natural footwear, ground living), focus on the experience. Play is the way
- Excellence through preparation
- Lead by example: ability on screens
- Attention to details (punctuality, timechecks, caring for the hosting facility)


Rituals:
- re-writing my notes the afternoon before the session (90min)
- debrief (what was good? what can be improved? what challenged me? did I have fun?)
