Begin spending 1 hour per day restoring your foot health [apply healthkit framework]

Week 1 covers:
- Proof of work
- Pain
- Screens

-------
PROOF OF WORK

- Begin taking daily notes in your POW log (sample sections/categories)
- Video from FNE?
- POW as it relates to the HealthKit (foot restoration phase of FNT): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr_gHXplV0A

Why is POW important?

PAIN

- Pain is an imporant feedback signal that we must strive to learn from instead of ignoring
- Pain is like a wise old man that guides you as you work to heal from an injury
- Qualifying pain is important so you can look back on data and detect patterns/trends. Detailed data = better results

- Qualifying elements: location (where is it?), sharp or dull, intermittent or constant, intensity (0 to 10), movements/activities/positions that ease the 
pain, movements/activities/positions that make the pain worse

- Be curious about pain, don't fear it. use it as a tool to better understand what is going on and whether things are progressing in the right direction

-------
SCREENS

- If we aren't measuring, we're guessing
- Screens are a feedback tool that confirm/refute whether our experiments are productive or not

- Be precise, be honest, help others screen themselves and get baseline measurements
- Re-test weekly and even after a training/experiment session
