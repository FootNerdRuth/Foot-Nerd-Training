Welcome to week 1 of Foot Nerd Training

Today marks your first day of spending 1 focused hour per day restoring excellent foot health. The flow is based on TFC's Foot & Ankle HealthKit and has
been modified for Foot Nerds who go deeper into the concepts than average people working through the HealthKit.

The daily hour will vary each day and form person to person. Here are examples of things you will fill that hour with:
- Reading github files
- Watching videos
- Planning out experiments
- Doing experiments
- Moving (walking, balance training)
- Playing
- Connecting with other Foot Nerds on Slack

----

In week 1 we cover: 
- Proof of work
- Pain
- Screens

-------
PROOF OF WORK

Why is POW included? (why it is important)

How does POW serve its purpose? what is the objective

What is POW within FNT?

- Begin taking daily notes in your POW log (sample sections/categories)
- Video from FNE?
- POW as it relates to the HealthKit (foot restoration phase of FNT): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr_gHXplV0A

Why is POW important?

PAIN

- Pain is an imporant feedback signal that we must strive to learn from instead of ignoring
- Pain is like a wise old man that guides you as you work to heal from an injury
- Qualifying pain is important so you can look back on data and detect patterns/trends. Detailed data = better results

- Qualifying elements: location (where is it?), sharp or dull, intermittent or constant, intensity (0 to 10), movements/activities/positions that ease the 
pain, movements/activities/positions that make the pain worse

- Be curious about pain, don't fear it. use it as a tool to better understand what is going on and whether things are progressing in the right direction

-------
SCREENS

Screens are an important feedback tool for measuring progress and assessing results of our experiments


- If we aren't measuring, we're guessing
- Screens are a feedback tool that confirm/refute whether our experiments are productive or not

- Be precise, be honest, help others screen themselves and get baseline measurements
- Re-test weekly and even after a training/experiment session


Creating concrete objectives/aspirations to achieve by the end of foot nerd training and planning how you will get there

Example: 
I am currently unable to achieve a resting squat position. By the end of Foot Nerd training, I will be able to rest comfortably in a squat for 60 seconds 
while breathing deeply and calmly. My plan to get there is to systematically address mobility at my ankles (measured w KTW) with 5 minutes of daily 
dorsiflexion mobilization, to increase my hip mobility by spending 30 minutes a day sitting on the floor in a variety of positions, training my balance 
for 5 minutes everyday and doing 20 slow, controlled squats daily and pausing in the bottom position to take a deep breath. 

I will screen my resting squat every 7 days to measure progress and take notes on how it feels and what I will focus on for the next 7 days.
