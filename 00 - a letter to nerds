I started the foot nerd project in 2019 as an effort to share what I had learned about feet

The simple, effective actions humans can take in order to restore excellent foot health

The information I wish I had been offered in physical therapy school but was badly missing

The project wandered into health more broadly and we have been experimenting with different structures, durations and framweworks since 2019 in an effort
to find the sweet spot that helps people the most on their quest to restore excellent health starting with the foundation

The 2022 experience was ambitious. A 360 day commitment to heath covering 36 different topics related to health in a broad sense

What we learned: in todays chaotic world, an ambitious commitment like that is hard to maintain for many people. It's simply too long and too difficult
to keep on track

Based on that lesson, we are doing a mid year restructring of the experience to shorten it, simplify it and to refocus on what we know best: feet

Foot Nerd Training is a 12 week commitment of 1 hour per day. Here is our proposed framework:

- Orientation (1 week)
- Foot restoration (6 weeks)
- Workshop training (2 weeks)
- Guide training (2 weeks)
- Debrief (1 week)

By the end of Foot Nerd Training, individuals will have significantly improved their foot heath, gained a better understanding of the process of restoring
foot health than I received over a 2 year masters of physical therapy, be ready to teach healthkit workshops in their community (if they wish) and be 
capable of helping individuals seeking to restore excellent foot health by guiding them through their 42 day healthkit journey (offered as a paid service)

In times of distraction, focus is a superpower

In times of uncertainty, conservation of energy is essential

With Foot Nerd Training, we're getting back to our roots and doing what we do best: helping people restore excellent foot health

All current FNE content will continue to be available to Nerds and we will continue to offer the longer health experience for those who wish to take that
journey
