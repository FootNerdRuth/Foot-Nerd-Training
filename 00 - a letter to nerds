Hello foot nerd family

I love you all and hope you are keeping well by taking excellent care of yourselves

I'm sending this letter because it seems to me that we have a storm approaching and we will be making changes to adapt accordingly

As the world changes, so too must our trajectory as a community and as a company. 

The approaching socioeconomic will test our collective resilience and has created a sense of urgency to shift our focus with the Foot Nerd project. 

This storm will not last forever and the beautiful world that lies on the otherside will be well worth the sacrifices we make to get there


Based on the state of the world and potential hard times ahead, we've decided to focus our resources on a clear and important mission: 

Expand the foot nerd community and update our training to help foot nerds to become health leaders within their local communities. 

We feel the current 360 day commitment is a powerful tool of transformation for those who a ready to commit but we're found the interest to be much lower
than expected. It's a long journey, it's difficult, and in todays chaotic world, many are finding it hard to stay the course and keep on track. 

A secondary element is also relevant: with an upcoming storm approaching, we want to make an effort to train as many foot nerds as possible within 6 months
and empower nerds with the ability and confidence to offer workshops and to act as a healthnode within their local communities so they can earn an income
helping others restore their health starting with the foundation.

The foot nerd project started in 2019 as an effort to share fundamental truths I had learned about feet & hips

The simple, effective, accessible actions humans could take in order to restore excellent foot health

The information I wish I had been offered in physical therapy school but was sadly missing

The project expanded into 6 pillar health and we have been working to improve the experience each year

The 2022 experience was ambitious. A 360 day commitment to heath covering a broad array topics. A guided journey to better health supported by community

What we learned: in todays chaotic world, an ambitious commitment like that is hard to maintain for many people. 

It's simply too long and too difficult for many to keep on track

We're refocusing on feet with a shorter commitment that prepares foot nerds to become healthnodes and feel confident to offer workshops

Foot Nerd Training is a 12 week commitment of 1 hour per day based on the following framework (still evolving):

- Orientation (1 week)
- Foot restoration (6 weeks)
- Synthesis/peer discussion (1 week) 
- Workshop training (2 weeks)
- Healthnode training (2 weeks)
- Debrief + POW submission (1 week)

By the end of Foot Nerd Training, individuals will have significantly improved their foot heath, gained a better understanding of the process of restoring
foot health than I received over a 2 year masters of physical therapy, be ready to teach workshops in their community (if they wish) and earn an income by 
helping individuals seeking to restore excellent foot health by guiding them through their 42 day healthkit journey (offered as a paid service)

In times of distraction, focus is a superpower

In times of uncertainty, conservation of energy is essential

With Foot Nerd Training, we're getting back to our roots and doing what we do best: helping people restore excellent foot health and forging health leaders

All content within the 360 day commitment will continue to be available to Nerds and we are considering offering the longer journey again in future

It's been an honour to learn alongside you all and I'm excited to continue the foot nerd project with a renewed focus so we can grow our numbers and expand
our positive impact on health culture starting with feet

This is a powerful community. Letâ€™s use that collective power to support and empower others to reclaim responsibilty for their health

Love you all

Nick
