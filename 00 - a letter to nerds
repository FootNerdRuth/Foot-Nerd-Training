Hello foot nerd family

I love you all and hope you are keeping well by taking excellent care of yourselves

I'm sending this letter because it seems to me that we have a storm approaching

A socioeconomic storm that will test our collective resilience

This storm will not last forever and the beautiful world that lies on the otherside of the storm will be worth the suffering


In preparation for the storm, we must teach as many people to swim as possible and inspire those people to help others swim

We cannot save them, but we can help them save themselves

As a company, we must conserve our energy and focus our resources on what we do best

You are all foot nerds

It's time to update our training to prepare for the road ahead. I hope you all join us as we do it together

This is a powerful community. Letâ€™s use that collective power to help humans restore health



The foot nerd project started in 2019 as an effort to share fundamental truths I had learned about feet & hips

The simple, effective, accessible actions humans could take in order to restore excellent foot health

The information I wish I had been offered in physical therapy school but was sadly missing

The project expanded into 6 pillar health and we have been working to improve the experience each year

The 2022 experience was ambitious. A 360 day commitment to heath covering a broad array topics. A guided journey to better health supported by community

What we learned: in todays chaotic world, an ambitious commitment like that is hard to maintain for many people. It's simply too long and too difficult
for many to keep on track

With a storm approaching, we must train as many foot nerds as possible to act as healthnodes within their respective communities

We are refocusing on feet with a shorter commitment that prepares foot nerds to become healthnodes and feel confident to offer workshops

Foot Nerd Training is a 12 week commitment of 1 hour per day. Here is our proposed framework:

- Orientation (1 week)
- Foot restoration (6 weeks)
- Synthesis/peer discussion (1 week) 
- Workshop training (2 weeks)
- Healthnode training (2 weeks)
- Debrief + POW submission (1 week)

By the end of Foot Nerd Training, individuals will have significantly improved their foot heath, gained a better understanding of the process of restoring
foot health than I received over a 2 year masters of physical therapy, be ready to teach workshops in their community (if they wish) and be capable of 
helping individuals seeking to restore excellent foot health by guiding them through their 42 day healthkit journey (offered as a paid service)

In times of distraction, focus is a superpower

In times of uncertainty, conservation of energy is essential

With Foot Nerd Training, we're getting back to our roots and doing what we do best: helping people restore excellent foot health

All current FNE content will continue to be available to Nerds and we will continue to offer the longer health experience for those who wish to take that
journey

It's been an honour to learn alongside you all and I'm excited to continue the foot nerd project with a renewed focus so we can forget more foot nerds and
expand our positive impact on health culture starting with feet

Love you all

Nick
