INTRO

Welcome to Foot Nerd training. Here is the plan for the next 12 weeks:
- 6 weeks restoring excellent foot health
- 1 week reviewing notes and sharing/discussing with peers
- 3 weeks learning how to deliver a TFC workshop and earn income by offering a workshop to your community
- 1 week understanding what it means to be a health leader in your community (Healthnode)
- 1 week debriefing from your experience and preparing your POW submission to complete FNT

Thank you for your commitment. Thank you for leading by example.

These 12 weeks will challenge you. They will push you beyond your comfort zone.

You are not alone on this journey. Foot Nerds are here to support you, witness your journey and to inspire you.

We wish you an enjoyable, playful, and rewarding 12 week journey and are grateful to have you as part of our global family.

A Foot Nerd is someone who:

- Explores health deeply, starting with their feet
- Spends time barefoot
- Leads by example
- Takes excellent care of themselves
- Makes income helping others restore excellent health starting with feet

Foot Nerds also love to play, are open minded, enjoy good faith disagreements, invest daily energy into their health and find purpose in being a health
resource for their community and a node within the global TFC network

We feel it's always better to learn than to be right

We understand that science is not a perfect tool but its the best one we have right now for determining truth
