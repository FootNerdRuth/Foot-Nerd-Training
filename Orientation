1 ------- The roadmap

Welcome to Foot Nerd training. Here is the plan for the next 12 weeks:

- 6 weeks restoring excellent foot health
- 1 week reviewing notes and sharing/discussing with peers
- 3 weeks learning how to deliver a TFC workshop and earn income by offering a workshop to your community
- 1 week understanding what it means to be a health leader in your community (Healthnode)
- 1 week debriefing from your experience and preparing your POW submission to complete FNT

Thank you for your commitment. Thank you for leading by example

These 12 weeks will challenge you. They will push you beyond your comfort zone

You are not alone on this journey. Foot Nerds are here to support you, witness your journey and to inspire you

We wish you an enjoyable, playful, rewarding 12 week journey and are grateful to have you as part of our global family


2 ------- What is a foot nerd?

A foot nerd is someone who:

- Explores health deeply, starting with their feet
- Spends time barefoot
- Leads by example
- Takes excellent care of themselves
- Makes income helping others restore excellent health starting with feet

We love to play, are open minded, enjoy good faith disagreements and invest energy everyday into our health

We find purpose in being a health resource for our local community. A Healthnode within the global TFC network

We feel it's always better to learn than to be right

We understand that science is not a perfect tool but it's the best one we have right now for determining truth


3 ------- Proof of work (pow)

[daily application of the concept is covered further in week 1]

Becoming a foot nerd involves a rigorous 12 week initiation which includes a proof of work submission to officially complete your training

A peer will review your pow submission and you will then receive a customized Nerd Tag in the mail to commemorate your accomplishment

There is no grading/evaluation. Having a peer review your submission is about having someone witness your journey

3 page proof of work submission guideline:

- 1 page summary of weeks 1-6
- 1 page summary of weeks 7-12
- 1 page workshop plan/debrief

Details: 
- bullet points are enouraged
- summary of weeks 1-6 to include baseline screen data and re-screen data at the end of week 6
- you are writing this for yourself. It's a cheat sheet that distills the most potent lessons learned over 12 weeks of training
- your workshop plan/debrief serves as your own workshop manual to be evolved and improved over time
- workshop plan: why are you giving a workshop? (purpose), when will you offer it? where will you host it? who will be invited? how will they pay?
- workshop debrief: how did it go? what went well? what challenges did you face? what do you want to improve? when will you offer the next one?


4 ------- Slack & Github

Slack is our virtual town square in foot nerd land

It's the plaform we use connect with each other to share stories, seek help, inspire one another and cross pollinate our journeys

There are dedicated channels for each week. Keep in context by engaging in the correct channel based on where you are in your 12 weeks

For private conversations, connect with other nerds via direct messages

Use the feedback channel to let us know how we can make foot nerd training better for you and for future nerds 

--

Github is where we host all foot nerd training content

It's a robust & free version control platform that allows us to continually update and evolve our knowledge

Each week of training has it's own github file which contains the content for that week

Library: a categorized repository of resources curated and created by foot nerds

Experiments: a searchbase of experiment templates categorized by screen for you to choose from

Dialogue covenant: The document that governs how we have conversations and disagreements within the foot nerd community (covered further in point 6)


5 ------- Layer 2 conversations

Sharing stories and engaging in good faith disagreement is how we evolve our knowledge as a community

If you connect with another foot nerd and think other foot nerds can benefit from your discussion, record it and we will make it available in the library

Ideas for layer 2 conversations:
- Sharing a story (your health story, a story about someone you're working with)
- Share a challenge you faced and how you overcame it
- Have a good faith disagreement about a specific topic
- Share an interaction you had with someone you're helping

**Layer 2 conversations will only be shared internally within the foot nerd community unless otherwise stated


6 ------- Dialogue covenant


Why?

How?
