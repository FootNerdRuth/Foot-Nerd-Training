INTRODUCTION 

In computer talk, a node is a point of intersection within a communication network capable of creating, receiving and transmitting information

In botany, a node is a part of a plant stem from which one or more leaves emerge

In health, a node is an individual who takes excellent care of themselves and finds purpose in being a resource for their community

A healthnode is a hub. A focal point. An individual that serves their community

A source of guidance for those who wish to restore health

A good listener. Someone who focuses on asking good questions instead of giving answers

Healthnodes are connected together digitally to learn from one another. They then transmit health intelligence to their local communities

We are health generalists with a specialty in feet. We understand health broadly and foot health deeply

CREATING INCOME

Placing a value on your time and energy

charging for your time

V4V

give people value and make it easy for people to pay you for your help

-------

Healthnodes take care of their communities by:

- Offering their time to work 1:1 with individuals motivated to improve their health
- Coordinating gatherings
- Leading workshops, experiences and play sessions
- Creating content that inspires and educates
- Pointing people to the right tools & resources (by understanding where someone currently is on their health journey and where they want to get to)

-------
Asking questions

Helping others when it comes to health is really about asking good qiestions, listening and being able to point to the right resources

The right resource for the specific human you're speaking with based on what their aspirations are, their current understanding, their current ability, 
and what they are willing to commit to learning

Giving someone answers removes the requirement for someone to explore, understand and figure out the answer for themselves

If we can't give answers, how do we help? By helping them understand the things they should stop doing and by directing them to good resources

-------
Project: Crafting your content database

Every Foot Nerd should create their own resource database. We evolve them over time as we continue learning and we cross pollinate our databases

A collection of your favourite resources to learn from on topics related to health

Simple database 

48 resources

For each pillar of health: a "basic" and "advanced" piece of content in each media type

Pillars: Food, Movement, Mind, Community, Sleep, Money
Content types: Book, Video, Article, Podcast 

Curate a library of your best stuff that can be shared with others who are curious to learn

Everyone learns different (hence different content types), has different aspirations, and wishes to focus on different things. Be preprared when someone
asks you a question

Valuable Healthnode trait: Being able to say "I don't know but ill look into it"

30min conversation about being a healthnode (Ruth & Nick)

A Foot Nerd begins by helping others restore excellent foot health

- has a deep understanding of how to restore foot health
- Someone who has walked the path and done the work
- Someone who leads by example

-------

Who are the people in your community (local + digital)
How do you become known in the community?


- I go on a lot of walks and greet or speak to everyone I encounter
- Organize gatherings for people who live in the same building as me (solstice gathering: invites, food, games, music)
- Meet business owners, ask them their stories and why they do what they do
- Card with link to intro video of who you are, why you do what you do, what you offer

------

Being a switchboard operator

Matching people who are curious with good resources and tools to empower them

Becoming known in your community: immerse yourself in community and engage (walks, businesses)

Understand the healthscape (the broad landscape of health) and help people navigate their way by leading by example and sharing your story
